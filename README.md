# Shiptivitas-To-Do-App

This project develops a web application as part of the JPMorgan Chase's [Software Engineering Virtual Internship](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/US/en/students/campaign/virtual-internship). In particular, the web application provides an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualizes daily movements of stock data in a clear and visually appealing manner as well as provides alerts for potential trading opportunities. Hence, this visualization of stock data feeds allows users to monitor potential trade strategies.

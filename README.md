# Shiptivitas-To-Do-App

This project develops a web application as part of the [Train to Work at a Y Combinator Startup](https://www.insidesherpa.com/virtual-internships/prototype/oRMogWRHeewqHzA7u/College-students%3A-Learn-how-to-work-at-a-YC-startup-) program. Specifically, the web application provided a simple to-do list tracking tool based on a kanban style board. This tool would support freight shippers to easily manage their shippig requests, thus increasing their shipping productivity and speed.
